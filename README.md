# SocialNetwork
Bash and git based social network tool "sn" for LAN environments

# Social Network based on git commands

## Overview
This is a bash script based Social network using git under the hood. This script enables you to share updates, posts and messages in a Local Area Network scenario among other developers. Once installed, you can use "sn --help" for help regarding available options.

## Getting started
Following are the dependencies required for setting up "sn"

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt install git -y
	sudo apt install tar -y
	```

## Provided problems 
This tool has been developed using Lubuntu 18.04 (Desktop-AMD) and git version 2.17.1. The tool requires data exchanfe over network and hence requires permissions for the same.


### Tests 
After running "install.sh", all the script executables will be placed in the '/home/$uname/bin' path. These files are give priviledge for being executable so now you can go to your terminal and type 'sn --help' and get all the possible options you can opt for.

#### Evaluation
Configure the script on each machine in a LAN environment with atleast three computers. SCRIPT WILL MAKE A NEW USER ACCOUNT FOR GIT BASED OPERATIONS.
