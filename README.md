# SocialNetwork
Bash and git based social network tool "sn" for LAN environments

# Social Network based on git commands

## Overview
This is a bash script based Social network using git under the hood. This script enables you to share updates, posts and messages in a Local Area Network scenario among other developers. Once installed, you can use "sn --help" for help regarding available options.

## Getting started
Following are the dependencies required for setting up "sn"
1. Install git and tar at each terminal:
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt install git -y
	sudo apt install tar -y
	```

## Provided problems 
This tool has been developed using Lubuntu 18.04 (Desktop-AMD) and git version 2.17.1. The tool requires data exchanfe over network and hence requires permissions for the same.


### Tests 
* Random                       -69590
* Round Robin                  -69638
* Round Robin IfTraffic        -3284
* Proportional Fair            -9595

details about this problem are provided in document *wireless/doc/TimeFreqResourceAllocation-v0.pdf*

#### Evaluation
The script runs 16 

## How to contribute
There are two main ways of contributing to Wireless Suite:

1. **Implementing new subcommands**: The first version of Wireless Suite contains only one problem implementation. New
problems can be easily added as simple variations of the first one (e.g. by changing its parameters), or by introducing
fully new problem implementations (e.g. Adaptive Modulation and Coding, Open Loop Power Control, Handover optimization,
etc).

2. **Implementing new methods**: Ideally, new agent contributions shall perform better than the default ones.
